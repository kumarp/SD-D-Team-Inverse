Chattr

Allows users to chat with strangers based on common interests.

This project makes use of Django v 1.3.1
For more information about Django, see https://www.djangoproject.com/

In the development of this project, we utilized django-jqchat available at: http://code.google.com/p/django-jqchat/.

That code is contained in the jqchat folder, as well as the file static/jqchat/scripts/jquery.min.js

In that folder, we modified the following files:
    templates/jqchat/chat_test.html
    static/jqchat/jqchat.js
    views.py
